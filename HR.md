### Money - Work
- "I think money probably matters to me about as much as it does to anyone. It's vital and necessary for us to live and prosper but, at the same time, it's not my single most important driving force. I believe that money is rewarded for work."

### Why you leave the job
- it's a career move. I have learned a lot from my last job, but now I am looking for new challenges to broaden my horizons and to gain a new skill-set.

### Why should we hire you?
- "I have a good experience in that particular field (field of your specialization), and I think my talents will be a big contribution to the continuing pursuit of excellence of your company."

### Assume you are hired, then how long would you expect to work for us?
- "Everyone looks for a bright future, healthy work environment, good salary, job satisfaction and I am pretty sure that your company gives such things, so I don't need to change the company."


### What is your objective in life? or Goal in Life
- "My short-term goal is to work in a reputed organization like yours where I can enhance my technical skills and knowledge.
- My long-term goal is to see the company at a topmost position where I am one of the people responsible for that."
- "My goal is to become a successful person and make my family proud of me."


###  What was the most difficult decision you have made in your past life?
- After completing my graduation, the toughest decision is whether to go for higher studies or do a job. Then I chose the job because getting trained is better than educated and it was also the demand of that time.
